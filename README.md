# Recursive Neural Language Processing

This project aims to extend [Recursive Neural Programs (RNPs)](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/2/11/pgad337/7317432) to the natural language domain. RNPs are ideally situated to model the recursive, hierarchical structure of natural language. 

## Objectives

* Produce a text VAE that recursively generates the input text, with noise resulting in semantically meaningful variations within each tree node

* Be able to extend noun or verb objects, e.g. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" -> "The quick brown fox, startled by a falling branch, jumps over Hank's lazy German shepherd"

* Use online predictive coding to fill in sentences as data is collected

* More!

## Todo list

1) Replicate RNPs in Pytorch
2) Autoencoder that generates text through a transformer-like attention process
3) More!
